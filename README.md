# BioTableModule

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BioTableModule is to make it easy to include tables of biological
data into a Shiny app, with sensible default formatting. Small numbers are 
automatically formatted using scientific formatting, and gene names are 
italicised.

This package is inspired by the [EPIGEN MeQTL Database](https://epicmeqtl.kcl.ac.uk/) 
Shiny app ([code](https://github.com/svillicana/EPIGEN_MeQTL_Database)).

## Installation

You can install the development version of BioTableModule from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("liz-is/BioTableModule")
```

## Example

A simple example app is available here: https://github.com/liz-is/BioTableDemo
